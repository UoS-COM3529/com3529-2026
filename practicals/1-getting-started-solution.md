# COM3529 Practical Session 1: Getting Started

## Solution

This first lab does not have a single correct solution, as figuring out what to test and how can be very subjective, particularly given no concrete testing goal or criteria – _and we will learn more about this throughout the course!_

See the following test classes for example solutions:

- [`TriangleTestSolution.java`](../code/lib/src/test/java/uk/ac/shef/com3529/TriangleTestSolution.java)
- [`CalendarTestSolution.java`](../code/lib/src/test/java/uk/ac/shef/com3529/CalendarTestSolution.java)

_How do these example solutions compare to yours?_
